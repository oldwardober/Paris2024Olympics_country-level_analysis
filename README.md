The presented notebook explores the relationship between the Olympic success (number of medals won) in Paris and some key country-level characteristics like GDP, population, life expectancy, political regime and gender equality. First, I performed exploratory analysis and next I used zero-inflated Poisson model to determine which of the above variables are assocciated with the success at Olympics. Zero-inflated Poisson model seems to be appropriate choice as the dependent variable (number of medals) is a count variable with excessive amount of zeros. The model indicates that only GDP was positively associated with Olympic success, while life expectancy, democracy and gender inequalilty had a negative effect.
